# scenarioQualityChecker

Scenario quality checker is being created as a part of Software Engineering course on PUT. The main purpose of the project is to apply the agile workflow to develop an application in groups.

It is a program that will provide quantitative information and enable detection of problems in functional requirements written in the form of scenarios. The application will be available via GUI and also as a remote API, thanks to which it can be integrated with existing tools.

The project is managed using trello. It is a private board available only to the group and the teacher.
